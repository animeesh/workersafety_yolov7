If you are looking for a computer vision and object detection kind of work than, I’d be happy to tailor it to your needs. Could you tell me more about your target market and audience? If you are unsure, I can brainstorm with you on this point.

Do let me know if you have any questions and I am excited to have the possibility to work on this project!

Best regards,
